1) Explore the location of the score solution with the given point against the mean. Can you explain the differences ?

2) Assign a weight of zero (0) to one of the variables and one (1) to the other, re run the problem, where does the solution lie? 

3) Switch the weights around what happens ? Why ?

4) Change the Weight of the Hotelling T2 to 0.0001 and re-run both scenarios (2) and (3), what do you observe

5) Change both weights to one (1) and change the hotellings T2 weight back to zero (0) and add a hard constraint for the Hotelling's T2 not to exceed the 95% CI
