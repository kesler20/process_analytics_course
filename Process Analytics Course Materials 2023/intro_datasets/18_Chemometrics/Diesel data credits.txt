Near Infrared Spectra of Diesel Fuels
These data consist of NIR spectra of diesel fuels along with various properties of those fules including:

bp50 - boiling point at 50% recovery, deg C (ASTM D 86)
CN - cetane Number (like Octane number only for diesel, ASTM D 613)
d4052 - density, g/mL, @ 15 deg C, (ASTM D 4052)
freeze - freezing temperature of the fuel, deg C
total - total aromatics, mass% (ASTM D 5186)
visc - viscosity, cSt, @ 40 deg C

 This data was obtained at Soutwest Research Institute (SWRI) on a project sponsored by the U.S. Army. Many thanks to them for letting us post it here!
