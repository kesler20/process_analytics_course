# Modules
## pyphi
Phi toolbox for multivariate analysis by Sal Garcia (salvadorgarciamunoz@gmail.com, sgarciam@ic.ac.uk)

Version 2.0 includes: Batch Analysis

Version 1.0 includes: Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Projection to Latent Structures (PLS), Locally Weighted PLS (LWPLS), Savitzy-Golay derivative and Standard Normal Variate pre-processing for spectra.

## pyphi_plots
A variety of plotting tools for models created with pyphi.

# Getting Started
Pyphi requires the following python packages: numpy, scipy, pandas, xlrd, bokeh, matplotlib, pyomo. These can be installed via setup.py below or manually using pip/conda and the ```requirements.txt``` file.

## Installation
1) Ensure you have Python 3 installed and accessible via your terminal ("python" command).
   - It's strongly encouraged you create a virtual environment using anaconda (```conda create -n your_pyphienv python```) or venv (```pip -m venv your_pyphienv```). You can then activate your environment ```conda activate your_pyphienv``` or venv Windows ```yourenv\Scripts\activate.bat``` or venv Linux/mac ```source yourenv/bin/activate``` ) and then install everything into a sandboxed environment.
2) Download this repository via ```git clone``` or manually using the download zip button at the top of the page.
3) Install the pyphi and pyphi_plots modules by opening a terminal window, navigating to the root of this repository, and typing ```python setup.py install```.

To confirm you have a working installation, navigate to the ```Examples``` folder and copy the ```Example_Script_testing_MD_by_NLP.py``` to the directory of your choice. Run ```python Example_Script_testing_MD_by_NLP.py```, verifying there are no errors logged to the console.

## Optional External Dependencies
- IPOPT as an executable in your system path or GAMS python module or GAMS executable in yoru system path.
  - Windows: ```conda install -c conda-forge IPOPT=3.11.1``` or download from [IPOPT releases page](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/releases), extract and add the IPOPT\bin folder to your system path or add all files to your working directory.
  - Mac/Linux: ```conda install -c conda-forge IPOPT```, download from [IPOPT releases page](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/releases), or [Compile using coinbrew](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/INSTALL.html#COINBREW).
- libhsl with ma57 within library loading path or in the same directory as IPOPT executable.
   - Speeds up IPOPT for large problems but requires a free academic or paid industrial license and a local IPOPT installation.
   - Must request in advance and building the source code is nontrivial. Expert use only.
- If IPOPT is not detected, pyphi will submit the pyomo models to the NEOS server to solve them remotely.
  - To use the NEOS server, the environment variable "NEOS_EMAIL" must be assigned a valid email. This can be done outside of python using set/set/export or use ```import os
  os.environ["NEOS_EMAIL"] = youremail@domain.com```
  in your code.

Adding a folder to your system path:
 - Windows: temporary ```set PATH=C:\Path\To\ipopt\bin;%PATH%``` or persistent ```setx PATH=C:\Path\To\ipopt\bin;%PATH%```.
 - Mac/Linux: ```export PATH=/path/to/ipopt:$PATH```, add to .profile/.*rc file to make persistent.
 - Both via Conda: after activating your environment, use ```conda env config vars set``` and your OS-specific set or export command.
